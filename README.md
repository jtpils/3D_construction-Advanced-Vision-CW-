# 3D_construction-Advanced-Vision-CW
The overall task for this assignment is to fuse the individual XYZ point clouds to create as much
of a complete 3D room model as possible. To do this you need to write a set of programs that
can:
1. Extract the relevant data from each point cloud.
2. Estimate the reference transformation linking each consecutive pair of frames.
3. Fuse all of the points into a single 3D coordinate system.
4. Build as complete a 3D model as possible and characterise the surfaces.
Each of these is described in more detail below.
